Norway, officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy 
whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus 
Jan Mayen and the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard.
</p>
<p>The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent 
territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim 
to Queen Maud Land, a territory which is larger than Greenland, more than seven 
times the size of Norway proper, and about one-fifth of the Antarctic landmass. 
On most maps there had been an unclaimed area between Queen Maud Land and the 
South Pole until June 12, 2015 when Norway formally annexed[10] that area.[11] 
Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), 
and Iceland (1262), which was lost through the Treaty of Kiel. 
</p>
<p>
The Kingdom also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468, as well as the Hebrides 
and the Isle of Man from 1098 to 1266.
